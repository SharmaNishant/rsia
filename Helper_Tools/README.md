# Helper Tools



## 1. Roslaunch Reader

Launch file parser tool for ROS based systems. We use this tool to parse [launch configuration files](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) for ROS and output a comprehensive list of all the nodes launch with their namespace, workspace, and remapping info. More details can be found [here](./roslaunch_reader/README.md).

Status: **Completed**

## 2. System Builder

System Builder is another utility which takes the input from roslaunch_reader and tries to increase automation in rsia. The goal of this tool is to reduce human interaction to the minimum. More details can be found [here](./system_builder/README.md).

Status: **Under Development**
